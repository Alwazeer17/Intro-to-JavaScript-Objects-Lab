Exercise 7
1. Evolve the starter Pokémon you added to your party earlier. Each starter Pokémon evolves into a specific one.
2. How would you replace the current starter Pokémon in your party with its evolved form?

Hint: 
  - Pokemon 1: Bulbasaur evolves into Pokemon 2: Ivysaur
  - Pokemon 4: Charmander evolves into Pokemon 5: Charmeleon
  - Pokemon 7: Squirtle evolves into Pokemon 8: Wartortle
  - Pokemon 25: Pikachu evolves into Pokemon 26: Raichu

More Hints: The existing starter Pokemon will be *replaced* in your party with the Pokemon it evolved into. When working with an array of objects, the splice() array method is ideal for replacing one element with another. 


Solve Exercise 7 here:
*/
const starterPokemon = game.party.find(pokemon => pokemon.starter === true);

let evolvedPokemon;

if (starterPokemon.Number === 1) {
  evolvedPokemon = pokemon.find(pokemon => pokemon.Number === 2); // Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur
} else if (starterPokemon.Number === 4) {
  evolvedPokemon = pokemon.find(pokemon => pokemon.Number === 5); // Charmander evolves into Charmeleon
} else if (starterPokemon.Number === 7) {
  evolvedPokemon = pokemon.find(pokemon => pokemon.Number === 8); // Squirtle evolves into Wartortle
} else if (starterPokemon.Number === 25) {
  evolvedPokemon = pokemon.find(pokemon => pokemon.Number === 26); // Pikachu evolves into Raichu
}

const index = game.party.indexOf(starterPokemon);
game.party.splice(index, 1, evolvedPokemon);

console.log(game.party);
