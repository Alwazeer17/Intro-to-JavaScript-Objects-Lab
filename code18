/*
Exercise 18
Add a new property to the `game` object called `collection` and initialize its value to an empty array.

Copy the `catchPokemon` method you wrote in Exercise Twelve and paste it below. Modify it so that:
  - Ensure that no more than six Pokemon can be in the party at any time. 
    Excess Pokemon should be placed in the `game.collection` array.
  - It's up to you how to distribute Pokemon in a situation where more than six 
    would be placed into the `game.party` array.

Again, for this exercise, it's okay to have a negative number of pokeballs.

After updating the method, use it by calling it and passing in a pokemon object of your choice from the `pokemon` data to catch it.

Also, log the `game.items` array to confirm that the pokeball quantity is being decremented.

Solve Exercise 18 here:

const game = {
  party: [],
  items: [
    { name: 'pokeball', quantity: 10 }
  ],
  collection: []
};

function catchPokemon(pokemon) {
  if (game.items[0].quantity > 0) {
    game.items[0].quantity--;

    if (game.party.length < 6) {
      game.party.push(pokemon);
    } else {
      game.collection.push(pokemon);
    }
  } else {
    console.log('Not enough Pokeballs!');
  }
}

const pikachu = { name: 'Pikachu', hp: 35 };
catchPokemon(pikachu);

const bulbasaur = { name: 'Bulbasaur', hp: 45 };
catchPokemon(bulbasaur);

console.log(game.items);
console.log(game.party);
console.log(game.collection);
