/*
Exercise 19
Copy the `catchPokemon` method that you just wrote above, and paste it below. The time has come to make it so that we cannot catch a Pokemon when we do not have any pokeballs to catch it with. 

Modify the method so that if there are no pokeballs a message will be displayed that there are not enough pokeballs to catch the desired Pokemon.

Also, ensure that the Pokemon isn't added to the `game.party` or the `game.collection`.

Solve Exercise 19 here:

function catchPokemon(pokemon) {
  if (game.items[0].quantity > 0) {
    game.items[0].quantity--;

    if (game.party.length < 6) {
      game.party.push(pokemon);
    } else {
      game.collection.push(pokemon);
    }
  } else {
    console.log('Not enough Pokeballs to catch ' + pokemon.name + '!');
  }
}

const pikachu = { name: 'Pikachu', hp: 35 };
catchPokemon(pikachu);

const bulbasaur = { name: 'Bulbasaur', hp: 45 };
catchPokemon(bulbasaur);

console.log(game.items);
console.log(game.party);
console.log(game.collection);
